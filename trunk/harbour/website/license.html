                    As a special exception, the Harbour Project gives permission for
                    additional uses of the text contained in its release of Harbour.                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
                    files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
                    resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
                    Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
                    linking the Harbour library code into it.                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
                    the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
                    Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
                    Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
                    Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
                    not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid isleading<br />
                    anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
                    this exception notice from them.                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
                    whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
                    If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.</td>
