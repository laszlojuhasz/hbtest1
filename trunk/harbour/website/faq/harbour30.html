  <H2><A NAME="30"></A>3.10. So what's with all these language extensions then?</H2>
<p>Hey, come on, there aren't that many!</p>
<p>Seriously, ok, hands up, you've got us bang to rights. Harbour does include
some extensions to &quot;standard&quot; Clipper but you'll notice that
these extensions are, on the whole, either replacements for &quot;must
have&quot; 3rd party add-ons that people used with 
<A HREF="harbour5.html#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</A> or they are a feature that is native to 
<A HREF="harbour56.html#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compiler implementations</A>.</p>
