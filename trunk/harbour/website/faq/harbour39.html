  <H2><A NAME="39"></A>4.5. Are there any rules on the lists?</H2>
<p>There are no <em>rules</em> as such but you might want to consider the following
guidelines:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Try to stay on topic. The 
<A HREF="harbour35.html#DevMailList">developer's list</A> is for Harbour design and development issues, the 
<A HREF="harbour36.html#UserMailList">user's list</A> is for Harbour usage discussion and
the 
<A HREF="harbour37.html#DisMailList">discussion list</A> is for general Harbour
discussion.
</li>
<li>Try not to mail binaries. Sometimes it is necessary on the development
list, if so, try to keep the size down, the developer's list is <b>very
busy</b>.
</li>
<li>Stick to plain text formatted email, 
<A href="http://expita.com/nomime.html">turn off</A> any HTML
&quot;features&quot;, content is far more important than form in the
Harbour lists.
</li>
<li>Stick to English. This isn't a UK/US/AU-centric thing, it just so
happens that English is more widely comprehended than any other language
available on the lists. If you use English you'll be read by the maximum
number of people.
</li>
<li>Don't use the subject as the message. Single line messages where the
message is in the subject don't carry a lot of information. Be verbose,
you'll stand a better chance of being understood.
</li>
<li>Do use the subject to outline a message. A descriptive subject is more
likely to catch the eye of the people whose eye you wanted to catch.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The above isn't an exhaustive list of guidelines, neither are any of the
above actually &quot;enforced&quot; (although you might find one or two
people politely suggesting you consider abiding by them). Generally speaking
the <em>rules</em> on the Harbour lists are those that apply to good email
composition in general.</p>
