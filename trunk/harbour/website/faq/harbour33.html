  <H2><A NAME="33"></A>3.13. I can't submit Clipper code either, can I still help anyway?</H2>
<p>You could help out any number of ways. Documentation is one area where

How about creating and maintaining binary snapshots of each of the releases?</p>
<p>Simply put, if you really want to help Harbour development, you'll find a
way.</p>
