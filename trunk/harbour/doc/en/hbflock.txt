      <nHandle>  Dos file handle

      set>  Offset of the first byte of the region to be locked.

      <nBytes>   Number of bytes to be locked.

      e>    The type (read or write) of lock requested.
   $RETURNS$
      <lSuccess> .T. if the lock was obtained, else .F.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function attempts to lock a region of the file whose file handle
      is <nHandle>. This is a low level file function.  To lock Harbour
      data files use either the FLock() or RLock() function.

      The value of <nHandle> is obtained from either a call to the FOpen()
      or the FCreate() function.

      <nOffset> is the offset (from the beginning of the file) to the first
      of the region to be locked.  (Offsets from the current position
      nd of file are not currently supported.)

      <nBytes> is the length of the region to be locked in bytes.

      e> is the type of lock requested.  There are two types of locks:
      sive write locks ( <nType> = 0x0000 ) - the default, and shared
      locks( <nType> = 0x0100 ).  Additionally you can specify a
      ing version of this function (that is it won't return until
      r  an error has occurred or the lock has been obtained) by
      g Ox0200 to the above values.

   $DESCRIPTION$
      This function attempts to unlock a region of the file whose file
      handle is <nHandle>. This is a low level file function.  To
      unlock Harbour data files use the dbUnlock() function.

      The value of <nHandle> is obtained from either a call to the FOpen()
      or the FCreate() function.

      <nOffset> is the offset (from the beginning of the file) to the first
