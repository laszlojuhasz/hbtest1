HARBOUR
=======

   "The Harbour Project is a Free Open Source Software effort to build
   a multiplatform Clipper language compiler. Harbour consists of the
   xBase language compiler and the runtime libraries with different
   terminal plugins and different databases (not just DBF)"

                                       http://www.harbour-project.org/


HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR
================================

   For all platforms you'll need:

   * Supported C compiler
   * GNU Make

   Linux/Darwin/BSD/HP-UX/Solaris
   ------------------------------
      $ export HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom|icc|gpp>
      $ export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      $ ./make_gnu.sh
      $ sudo ./make_gnu.sh install

      To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
      $ ./hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   Windows with MinGW + msys
   -------------------------
      This is the recommended way to build with MinGW.

      Make sure to have msys and MinGW properly configured.
      msys should be put in PATH _before_ MinGW.

      > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      > sh make_gnu.sh install

      To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
      > hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   Windows with Cygwin
   -------------------
      Make sure to have Cygwin properly configured.

      > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      > sh make_gnu.sh install

      To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
      > hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: <DIR> should use Cygwin drive notation: /cygdrive/c for C:

   Windows with other compilers (MSVC, Watcom, Borland, Pelles, etc.)
   ----------------------------
      Platform specific prerequisites:

      1.) Windows NT or compatible system is required to build Harbour.
      2.) Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly installed.
          Refer to your C compiler installation and setup instructions for
          details. It's recommended to make sure no tools in your PATH
          belonging to other C compilers are interfering with your setup.
          For the list of supported compilers, please look up the
          relevant section of this file.
      3.) Make sure to have GNU Make. We recommend the one distributed
          by MinGW team. Use this link to get it:
            https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=23918
          If you have it, you have three choices:
          - Put mingw32-make.exe anywhere in your PATH. (recommended)
          - Put mingw32-make.exe in Harbour source root dir.
          - Rename mingw32-make.exe to make.exe and put it in
            your PATH _before_ your compiler tools.

      > set HB_COMPILER=<msvc|owatcom|bcc|pocc|...>
      > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      > make_gnu.bat install

      To test it, go to <DIR>\bin directory and type:
      > hbmk2 ..\tests\hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: <DIR> is your destination directory where executables,
            libraries and headers will be created. Use absolute paths
            only. For a peace of mind, avoid using spaces, quotes
            in the name. You can leave it empty, in this case the
            results will be created under the current directory tree.

   DOS
   ---
      > set HB_COMPILER=<[djgpp]|owatcom>
      > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      > make_gnu.bat install

   OS/2
   ----
      > set HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom>
      > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
      > make_gnu_os2.cmd install


HOW TO ENABLE OPTIONAL COMPONENTS BEFORE BUILD
==============================================

   Some Harbour parts (typically contrib libraries) depend on 3rd
   party components. To make these Harbour parts built, you need
   to tell Harbour where to find the required 3rd party components
   (typically headers).

   On *nix systems most of these 3rd party components will
   automatically be picked up if installed in some well-known
   standard system locations.

   You only need to use manual setup if the dependency isn't available
   on your platform on a system location, or you wish to use
   a non-standard location. Typically you need to do that on non-*nix
   (Windows/DOS/OS2) systems for all packages and for a few packages on
   *nix which aren't available through official package managers
   (ADS Client f.e.). Please see a list of official packages in
   doc/linux1st.txt.

   You can set these environment variables before starting
   the build. Make sure to adjust them to your own directories:

   HB_INC_ADS=C:\ads\acesdk
   HB_INC_ALLEGRO=C:\allegro\include
   HB_INC_APOLLO=C:\Apollo\include
   HB_INC_BLAT=C:\blat\full\source
   HB_INC_CURL=C:\curl\include
   HB_INC_FIREBIRD=C:\Firebird\include
   HB_INC_FREEIMAGE=C:\FreeImage\Dist
   HB_INC_GD=C:\gd\include
   HB_INC_LIBHARU=C:\libharu\include
   HB_INC_MYSQL=C:\mysql\include
   HB_INC_OPENSSL=C:\openssl\inc32
   HB_INC_PGSQL=C:\pgsql\include

   NOTES: - For mingw and cygwin you have to use forward slashes
            and also cygwin drive notation for cygwin.
          - Space in directory names isn't currently supported.
          - Don't put the dir inside double quotes.
          - Use absolute paths.

   Darwin (OS X)
   -------------
   1.) Install MacPorts, follow their instructions:
       http://www.macports.org/
   2.) sudo port install allegro freeimage gd2 mysql5-devel postgresql83

OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN BUILDING HARBOUR
=======================================

   You can fine-tune Harbour builds with below listed
   environment variables. All of these are optional.

   General
   -------
   - HB_USER_PRGFLAGS          User Harbour compiler options
   - HB_USER_CFLAGS            User C compiler options
   - HB_USER_LDFLAGS           User linker options for executables
   - HB_USER_AFLAGS            User linker options for libraries
   - HB_USER_MAKEFLAGS         User GNU Make options

   - HB_BIN_INSTALL            Target directory to install executables
   - HB_LIB_INSTALL            Target directory to install libraries
   - HB_INC_INSTALL            Target directory to install language headers
   - HB_DOC_INSTALL            Target directory to install documentation

   Special
   -------
   - HB_BUILD_DLL=yes          To create a full build with .dlls.
                               This is only needed and available for
                               non-GNU Windows compilers. When using this,
                               full clean + install cycles will automatically
                               be executed, so you don't have to explicitly
                               pass them to make_gnu.bat.
   - HB_BUILD_DEBUG=yes        Create a debug build.
   - HB_CONTRIBLIBS=no         Don't build any contrib libraries.
   - HB_CONTRIBLIBS=[<list>]   Build space separated <list> of
                               contrib libraries. Build all if
                               left empty.
   - HB_CONTRIB_ADDONS=<list>  Build additional libraries stored
                               in the contrib directory.
   - HB_VISUALC_VER_PRE80=yes  Set this if you're using a pre-8.0
                               (= pre-MSVS 2005) version of MSVC compiler.
   - HB_REBUILD_PARSER=yes     To rebuild the language parsers. Typically
                               you only need this if your are Harbour core
                               developer modifying the parser.
                               This requires GNU Bison 1.28 or upper.

   Cross building
   --------------
   HB_BIN_COMPILE=<HARBOUR_NATIVE_BUILD_DIR>\bin
   HB_PPGEN_PATH=<HARBOUR_NATIVE_BUILD_DIR>\bin

   You need these when building for a platform different to host.
   For this to work, you will need to point above envvars to
   a native Harbour build available on your system. You don't need
   a full native build, harbour.exe and hbpp.exe are enough for
   the process to succeed.
