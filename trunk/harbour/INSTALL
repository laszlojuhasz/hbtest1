HARBOUR
=======

   "The Harbour Project is a Free Open Source Software effort to build
    a multiplatform Clipper language compiler. Harbour consists of the
    xBase language compiler and the runtime libraries with different
    terminal plugins and different databases (not just DBF)"

                                       http://www.harbour-project.org/


1. HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE
===============================================

   NOTE: Before reporting a problem on the developers' mailing list, please
         make sure to read the TROUBLESHOOTING section in this file.

   For all platforms you'll need:

   * Supported ANSI C compiler
   * GNU Make (3.81 or upper)
   * Harbour sources (2.0.0 or upper)

   on Windows hosts
   ----------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

      Platform specific prerequisites:

      1.) Windows XP or upper system is recommended to build Harbour.
      2.) Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly installed
          (in PATH). Refer to your C compiler installation and setup
          instructions for details. It's recommended to make sure no tools
          in your PATH belonging to other C compilers are interfering with
          your setup. For the list of supported compilers, please look up
          the relevant section in this file.
      3.) You need to get GNU Make. We recommend this link:
             http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/GNU%20Make/Current%20Release_%20mingw32-make-3.81-20080326/mingw32-make-3.81-20080326-3.tar.gz/download
          Unpack it to your PATH or Harbour source root directory.
          If you use MinGW compiler, you already have GNU Make.
          You can also use included copy named win-make.exe instead.

      > mingw32-make install

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Windows hosts with POSIX shells (MSYS/Cygwin)
   ----------------------------------
      You can also use these shells to build Harbour on Windows.
      Generally it's recommended to use native shell though.

      > sh -c make install

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: When building for Borland C++ make sure that GNU Make 
            is executed when typing 'make', Borland Make has the same name.

   on MS-DOS hosts
   ---------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, OS/2, Linux)

      1.) Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly installed
          (in PATH).
      2.) You need to get GNU Make. We recommend this link:
             ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/beta/v2gnu/mak381b.zip
          Unpack it to your PATH or Harbour source root directory.
          You can also use included copy named dos-make.exe instead.

      > make install

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on OS/2 hosts
   -------------
   (possible cross-build targets: MS-DOS, OS/2, Linux)

      1.) You need to get GNU Make. If you use OS/2 host, we recommend this link:
             ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/util/make-3.81-r3-bin-static.zip
          If you use other host, please refer to other platform instructions
          in this section.
          You can also use included copy named os2-make.exe instead.

      > make install

      To test it, type:
      > cd tests
      > ..\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg
      > hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE: To select alternative TCP/IP stack, use these commands:
            set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DTCPV40HDRS %HB_USER_CFLAGS%
            set HB_USER_LDFLAGS=-LC:\usr\lib\tcpipv4 %HB_USER_LDFLAGS%

   on Linux hosts
   --------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS, OS/2)

      $ make install [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on Darwin (Mac OS X) hosts
   --------------------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

      Platform specific prerequisite: XCode installed

      $ make install [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

   on BSD/HP-UX/Solaris/BeOS/Haiku/*nix hosts
   ------------------------------------------
   (possible cross-build targets: Windows, Windows CE, MS-DOS)

      $ gmake install [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]
      OR
      $ make install [HB_PLATFORM=<...>]

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.

      NOTE for sunpro on Solaris:
      ---------------------------
         If you have any GNU binutils stuff installed, do make sure
         /usr/ccs/bin (the location of the native Sun C compilation
         system tools) come *before* the GNU binutils components in
         your $PATH.

   on FreeBSD hosts
   ----------------
      Platform specific prerequisites:

      1.) You'll need to have the developer tools installed.
      2.) Then you'll need to install gmake and optionally bison.
          If you installed the ports collection, then all you need
          to do to install bison and gmake is to run the following
          commands, which may require that you run su root first to
          get the correct permissions:

          $ cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
          $ make
          $ make install
          $ make clean
          $ cd /usr/ports/devel/bison
          $ make
          $ make install
          $ make clean

      $ gmake install

      To test it, type:
      $ cd tests
      $ hbmk2 hello.prg
      $ ./hello
      You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.


2. HOW TO DO A PARTIAL [RE]BUILD
================================

   If you want to [re]build only a specific part of Harbour, like
   one library, all contrib libs or core libs, you have to do
   everything the same as for a full build, the only difference
   is that you first have to go into the specific source directory
   you want to [re]build. When starting GNU Make, all components
   under that dir will be built:

      cd src/rtl
      <make> [clean] [install]


3. HOW TO CREATE DISTRIBUTABLE PACKAGES
=======================================

   Source .tgz on *nixes
   ---------------------

      $ ./mpkg_src.sh

   Binary .tgz on *nixes
   ---------------------

      $ ./mpkg_tgz.sh

   Binary .deb on Linux
   --------------------

      $ fakeroot debian/rules

   Binary .rpm on Linux
   --------------------

      for native build:
         $ ./mpkg_rpm.sh
      for Windows cross-build:
         $ ./mpkg_rpm_win.sh
      for Windows CE cross-build:
         $ ./mpkg_rpm_wce.sh

   Binary .zip + .exe on Windows for all targets (except Linux)
   ------------------------------------------------------------

      > set HB_DIR_NSIS=%ProgramFiles%\NSIS\
      > set HB_DIR_ZIP=C:\info-zip\
      > set HB_BUILD_PKG=yes
      (then run build as usual, see: HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE)

   Binary .zip on MS-DOS for all targets (except Linux)
   ----------------------------------------------------

      > set HB_DIR_ZIP=C:\info-zip\
      > set HB_BUILD_PKG=yes
      (then run build as usual, see: HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR FROM SOURCE)

   Unified .7z + .exe installer for Windows
   ----------------------------------------

      [ To be completed. All required files and scripts reside in package/winuni.
        This is a semi-manual process yet. ]


4. HOW TO ENABLE OPTIONAL COMPONENTS BEFORE BUILD
=================================================

   Certain Harbour parts (typically contrib libraries) depend on 3rd
   party components. To make these Harbour parts built, you need
   to tell Harbour where to find the required 3rd party components
   (typically headers).

   On *nix systems most of these 3rd party components will
   automatically be picked up if installed on well-known standard
   system locations.

   You only need to use manual setup if the dependency isn't available
   on your platform on a system location, or you wish to use
   a non-standard location. Typically you need to do that on non-*nix
   (Windows, MS-DOS, OS/2) systems for all packages and for a few packages
   on *nix which aren't available through official package managers
   (ADS Client f.e.).

   You can set these environment variables before starting
   the build. Make sure to adjust them to your own directories:

   HB_WITH_ADS=C:\ads\acesdk
   HB_WITH_ALLEGRO=C:\allegro\include
   HB_WITH_BLAT=C:\blat\full\source
   HB_WITH_CURL=C:\curl\include
   HB_WITH_CURSES= (on *nix systems and DJGPP, where it's autodetected)
   HB_WITH_FIREBIRD=C:\Firebird\include
   HB_WITH_FREEIMAGE=C:\FreeImage\Dist
   HB_WITH_GD=C:\gd\include
   HB_WITH_GPM= (on Linux only)
   HB_WITH_LIBHARU=C:\libharu\include (defaults to locally hosted version)
   HB_WITH_MYSQL=C:\mysql\include
   HB_WITH_ODBC= (may only be needed on non-Windows systems)
   HB_WITH_OPENSSL=C:\openssl\inc32 OR C:\openssl\include
   HB_WITH_PCRE=C:\pcre (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_PGSQL=C:\pgsql\include
   HB_WITH_PNG=C:\libpng (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_QT=C:\Qt\include
   HB_WITH_SLANG= (on *nix systems)
   HB_WITH_SQLITE3=C:\sqlite3 (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)
   HB_WITH_WATT= (on MS-DOS systems)
   HB_WITH_X11= (on *nix systems)
   HB_WITH_ZLIB=C:\zlib (defaults to locally hosted version if not found)

   To explicitly disable any given components, use the value 'no' (without
   quotes). This may be useful to avoid autodetection of installed packages
   on *nix systems. You may also use the value 'local' to force using the
   locally hosted copy of these packages, where applicable. 'nolocal' will
   explicitly disable using locally hosted copies.

   NOTES: - You need to use native path format to your shell/OS.
          - Spaces in directory names aren't currently supported.
            (You can use 8.3 name alias on Windows platform, though)
          - Don't put directory names inside double quotes.
          - Use absolute paths.

   Windows/Windows CE
   ------------------

      Some contribs support build mode in which they can be linked
      *statically* with 3rd party components:

      HB_QT_STATIC=yes

   Darwin (Mac OS X)
   -----------------

      1.) Install MacPorts, follow their instructions:
          https://www.macports.org/
      2.) $ sudo port install pcre slang allegro freeimage gd2 mysql5-devel postgresql84 
          $ sudo port install upx

      - gpm-devel

   FreeBSD
   -------

      If you want to use the gtsln library instead of gtstd or gtcrs,
      then you also need to install libslang. If you installed the ports
      collection, then all you need to do to install libslang is to run
      the following commands, which may require that you run su first to
      get the correct permissions:

      $ cd /usr/ports/devel/libslang
      $ make
      $ make install
      $ make clean

6. OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN BUILDING HARBOUR
==========================================

   You can fine-tune Harbour builds with below listed
   environment variables. You can add most of these via the
   GNU Make command line also, using 'make VARNAME=value' syntax.
   All of these settings are optional.

   General
   -------
   - HB_PLATFORM               Override platform autodetection
   - HB_COMPILER               Override C compiler autodetection
                               See this section for possible values:
                               SUPPORTED PLATFORMS AND C COMPILERS
                               See also: HB_CC* settings.

   - HB_USER_PRGFLAGS          User Harbour compiler options
   - HB_USER_CFLAGS            User C compiler options
   - HB_USER_LDFLAGS           User linker options for executables
   - HB_USER_AFLAGS            User linker options for libraries
   - HB_USER_DFLAGS            User linker options for dynamic libraries

   - HB_INSTALL_PREFIX         Target root directory to install Harbour files.
                               This will default to Harbour source tree on
                               non-*nix systems. On *nix systems the default
                               is set to /usr/local/ or $(PREFIX) if specified,
                               and /usr/local/harbour-<arch>-<comp> for
                               cross-builds. It's always set to /pkg/<arch>/<comp>
                               when HB_BUILD_PKG is set to 'yes'.
                               Use absolute paths only. For a peace of mind,
                               avoid using spaces and quotes in the name.
                               You have to use path format native to your shell.
                               F.e. to specify C:\dir on Windows, with Cygwin
                               you should use /cygdrive/c/dir, with MSYS /c/dir.
                               It's also possible to use following macros:
                                  {hb_top}  - Source tree root dir
                                  {hb_plat} - Target platform
                                  {hb_comp} - Target compiler
                                  {hb_cpu}  - Target CPU

   - HB_BIN_INSTALL            Override directory to install executables
   - HB_LIB_INSTALL            Override directory to install libraries
   - HB_DYN_INSTALL            Override directory to install dynamic libraries
   - HB_INC_INSTALL            Override directory to install language headers
   - HB_DOC_INSTALL            Override directory to install documentation

   Special
   -------
   - HB_BUILD_NAME=[<name>]    Create named build. This allows to keep
                               multiple builds in parallel for any given
                               platform/compiler. F.e. debug / release.
                               NOTE: In current implementation it's
                               appended to compiler directory name, so all
                               filesystem/platform name rules and limits
                               apply. It's valid to use (back)slashes though.
   - HB_BUILD_PKG=yes          Create release package. Default: no
                               Requires 'clean install' in root source dir.
                               (currently on Windows/Windows CE/MS-DOS)
                               (only when using Windows NT shells)
   - HB_BUILD_DLL=no           Create Harbour dynamic libraries. Default: yes
   - HB_BUILD_SHARED=yes       Create Harbour executables in shared mode.
                               Default: yes when HB_INSTALL_PREFIX points

                               tool name postfix (usually version number).

   Cross-building
   --------------

   You can build Harbour for target platforms different than host
   platform. F.e. you can create Windows build on *nix systems, Linux
   builds on Windows systems, etc. It's also possible to build targets
   for different than host CPU architectures. F.e. you can create
   Windows 64-bit build on 32-bit Windows platform, or Linux x86-64
   build on x86 hosts, or Linux MIPS build on x86 host, etc.

   Point this envvar to the directory where native Harbour executables
   for your host platform can be found:
      HB_BIN_COMPILE=<HARBOUR_NATIVE_BUILD_DIR>\bin

   If you leave this value empty, the make system will try to autodetect it,
   so in practice all you have to do is to create a native build first (no
   'install' required), then create the cross-build. If you set this value
   manually, it may be useful to know that only harbour, hbpp and hbmk2
   executables are required for a cross-build process to succeed.

      NOTES: - All code below should be copied to batch files or typed at NT
               command line.
             - Naturally, you'll need to adapt dirs to valid ones on your system.
               Don't use spaces in dirs.
             - You can use additional 'clean', 'install' or 'clean install'
               (without quotes) make parameters depending on what you want to do.
             - To redirect all output to a log file, append this after the make
               command: '> log.txt 2>&1' (without quotes)

8. HOW TO GET THE HARBOUR SOURCES
=================================

   1.) It's possible you're reading this file as part of the Harbour
       source code package. If not, read along.

   2.) Harbour source repository

       You'll need Subversion (SVN) version control software installed
       on your system, and issue this command:
          svn co https://harbour-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/harbour-project/trunk/harbour

       You can get subsequent updates using this command:
          svn update

   3.) Harbour nightly sources (updated once a day from source repository)

       Download source archive from any of these links and unpack:
          http://harbour-project.org/harbour-nightly.zip
          http://harbour-project.org/harbour-nightly.tgz
          http://harbour-project.org/harbour-nightly.bz2

   4.) Harbour source download (stable)

       Download source archive from this page and unpack:
          http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=681&package_id=192305


9. TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

   Please evaluate these points before reporting an issue on the developers'
   mailing list.

   - Make sure to have carefully read this document.
   - Make sure to do a 'clean' before doing a build after refreshing
     the sources.
   - Make sure to install fresh source tree in a new local directory and
     start over. See HOW TO GET THE HARBOUR SOURCES section for instructions
     to get the source.
   - Keep you PATH clean from old, mixed compiler tools or other Harbour
     versions when building Harbour. The surest way to achieve this is to
     leave only compiler directory in PATH:
        set PATH=C:\<compilerdir>
   - Remove all old, unnecessary environment variables from your environment.
     Use only those documented in this file.
   - Try to do no or only small modifications at once to command examples
     included in this file. If it doesn't work, fall back to documented
     examples as is.


10. QUICK START TO BUILD YOUR OWN HARBOUR APPLICATIONS
======================================================

   For all platforms you'll need two things:

   * Harbour binaries

       Either a Harbour binary distribution or a local Harbour
       build will be okay. If you're reading this text, it's
       very likely you have one of these already.

   * Supported ANSI C compiler

       Your compiler of choice has to be placed in the PATH
       (and configured appropriately according to instructions).
       If you use official Harbour binary distribution on Windows,
       you already have MinGW compiler embedded in the installation,
       which will automatically be used, so you don't have to
       make any extra steps here.

   Examples to build a Harbour application:

   - To build one simple .prg:
       'hbmk2 hello.prg'
   - To build multiple .prg sources into one application:
       'hbmk2 mymain.prg client.prg'
   - To build an application using a project file:
       'hbmk2 myapp.hbp'
   - To build an application using incremental mode:
       'hbmk2 myapp.hbp -inc'
   - To build an application which uses a contrib library:
       'hbmk2 myapp.prg -lhbct'
   - To build an application which uses a 3rd party library:
       'hbmk2 myapp.prg -lsuplib -L<path_to_lib>'
   - To build an application which uses a 3rd party library,
     and the 3rd party lib has an .hbc file:
       'hbmk2 myapp.prg rddleto.hbc -L<path_to_letodb>'
   - To build an application which uses Windows resources:
       'hbmk2 mymain.prg client.prg myres.rc'
   - To build an application which links against Harbour dynamic libraries:
       'hbmk2 -shared hello.prg'
   - To build an application out of all .prg and .c sources residing
     in 'source' subdir:
       'hbmk2 -omyapp src/*.prg src/*.c'

   Examples to build a Harbour static library:

   - To build library 'mylib' from sources:
       'hbmk2 mylibsrc.prg -omylib -hblib'
   - To build library 'mylib' from sources using incremental mode:
       'hbmk2 mylibsrc.prg -omylib -hblib -inc'

   NOTES: - Most of the above features can be combined. F.e. to use
            incremental build in any of the above commands, just add
            '-inc' switch.
          - List all available options:
            'hbmk2 -help'
            Besides the ones listed, you can use all regular Harbour
            compiler command line options, like:
               '-l', '-b', '-n', '-w3' (etc...)
          - To make it easier to work with Harbour, it's recommended to
            put Harbour binary directory into the PATH:
               set PATH=C:\harbour\bin;%PATH% (on Windows)
            (this is not a requirement though)
          - You can access hbmk2 using absolute or relative paths, and
            it will work equally well:
               'C:\hb20\bin\hbmk2 hello.prg'
          - GNU Make, MSYS, or any other extra tool is *not* needed
            to build a Harbour application with above methods.

13. HOW TO PARTICIPATE
======================

   There are several ways to help making Harbour better:

   - You can give feedback/suggestions to developers on available
     channels.
   - You can submit patches or source code on above channels.
     Patches are accepted in 'svn diff' or 'diff -u' format.
     Always .zip your patch/source files before attaching them.
     The size limit for e-mails sent to the development list is
     70KB. If you need more, upload it to a site where we can
     access it, or use the sf.net page to submit it.
   - Given a good history of valuable contributions, you can get
     write access to the source repository.
   - Of course there is more into Harbour contribution than writing
     code, so you're welcome to do so in other areas like documentation,
     helping fellow users, giving input on decisions, testing in
     various environments, etc.
