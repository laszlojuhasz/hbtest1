HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR
================================

For all platforms you'll need:

* GNU make
* Supported C compiler

Linux/Darwin/BSD/HP-UX/Solaris
------------------------------
   $ export HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom|icc|...>
   $ export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   $ ./make_gnu.sh
   $ sudo ./make_gnu.sh install

   To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
   $ ./hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
   $ ./hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

Windows with MinGW + msys
-------------------------
   This is the recommended way to build with MinGW.

   Make sure to have msys and MinGW properly installed
   and setup. msys should be put in PATH _before_ MinGW.

   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR> (use forward slashes and msys drive notation: /c/)
   > sh make_gnu.sh install

   To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
   > hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
   > hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

Windows with other compilers
----------------------------
   Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly
   installed and GNU Make (with the name make.exe)
   accessible in the PATH _before_ the compiler tools.

   > set HB_COMPILER=<msvc|bcc32|owatcom|...>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu.bat install

   To test it, go to <DIR>\bin directory and type:
   > hbmk2 ..\tests\hello.prg
   > hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

DOS
---
   > set HB_COMPILER=<[djgpp]|owatcom>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu.bat install

OS/2
----
   > set HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom|icc>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu_os2.cmd install
