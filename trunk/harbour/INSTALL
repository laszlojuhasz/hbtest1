HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL HARBOUR
================================

For all platforms you'll need:

* GNU make
* Supported C compiler

Linux/Darwin/BSD/HP-UX/Solaris
------------------------------
   $ export HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom|icc|...>
   $ export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   $ ./make_gnu.sh
   $ sudo ./make_gnu.sh install

   To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
   $ ./hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
   $ ./hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

Windows with MinGW + msys
-------------------------
   This is the recommended way to build with MinGW.

   Make sure to have msys and MinGW properly installed
   and setup. msys should be put in PATH _before_ MinGW.

   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR> (use forward slashes and msys drive notation: /c/)
   > sh make_gnu.sh install

   To test it, go to <DIR>/bin directory and type:
   > hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg
   > hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

Windows with other compilers
----------------------------
   Make sure to have your C compiler of choice properly
   installed and GNU Make (with the name make.exe)
   accessible in the PATH _before_ the compiler tools.
   We recommend using the GNU Make from the MinGW binary
   distribution. Use your search engine with 'mingw gnu make'
   or try this link:
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435

   > set HB_COMPILER=<msvc|bcc32|owatcom|...>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu.bat install
     or
   > make_gnu.bat --install-with-dll

   To test it, go to <DIR>\bin directory and type:
   > hbmk2 ..\tests\hello.prg
   > hello
   You should see: 'Hello world!' on screen.

   NOTE: <DIR> is your destination directory where
         executables, libraries and headers will be
         created. For a peace of mind, avoid using
         spaces, quotes in the name.

DOS
---
   > set HB_COMPILER=<[djgpp]|owatcom>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu.bat install

OS/2
----
   > set HB_COMPILER=<[gcc]|owatcom|icc>
   > set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
   > make_gnu_os2.cmd install


HOW TO ENABLE OPTIONAL COMPONENTS BEFORE BUILD
==============================================

On *nix systems most of these will be automatically picked up if
installed in some well-known standard system locations.

You only need to use manual setup, if the dependency isn't available
on your platform on a system location, or you wish to use a non-standard
location. Typically you need to do that on non-*nix (Windows/DOS/OS/2)
systems for all packages and for a few packages on *nix which aren't
available through official package managers (ADS Client f.e.). Please
see a list of official packages in doc/linux1st.txt.

You can use these environment variables:

HB_INC_ADS=C:\ads\acesdk
HB_INC_ALLEGRO=C:\allegro\include
HB_INC_APOLLO=C:\Apollo\include
HB_INC_BLAT=C:\blat\full\source
HB_INC_CURL=C:\curl\include
HB_INC_FIREBIRD=C:\Firebird\include
HB_INC_FREEIMAGE=C:\FreeImage\Dist
HB_INC_GD=-IC:\gd\include
HB_INC_LIBHARU=-IC:\libharu\include
HB_INC_MYSQL=C:\mysql\include
HB_INC_OPENSSL=C:\openssl
HB_INC_PGSQL=C:\pgsql\include
