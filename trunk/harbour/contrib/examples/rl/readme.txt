Copy the full content of /SOURCE/RL from your original 
CA-Cl*pper installation, and run the batch file to compile.

If source code is present in this directory, it will be 
patched by hb_rl.dif to make the original code run better 
under various platforms. This patch is optional, you can 
delete it if you want.
