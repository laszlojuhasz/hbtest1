and unpack into this directory.

NOTES: - In order to unpack and *use* this package, you'll
         need Cygwin package (from http://cygwin.com) installed
         and put in PATH for Cygwin runtime (cygwin1.dll).
       - To unpack:
            > sh
            $ tar -zxvf cygwin-cegcc-mingw32ce-0.51.0-1.tar.gz
            $ exit
       - Move content of /opt/mingw32ce directory to this one.
       - If you feel unconfortable with Cygwin shell, you can
         use gzip and GNU Tar to unpack it from Windows command
         line, using these commands:
            > gzip -d cygwin-cegcc-mingw32ce-0.51.0-1.tar.gz
            > tar -xvf cygwin-cegcc-mingw32ce-0.51.0-1.tar -h

UPDATE: It seems the cegcc team doesn't provide this binary download
        anymore. Please consult their website for more information.
