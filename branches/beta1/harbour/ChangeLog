  * harbour/source/rtl/set.c
    * changed default initialization of _SET_DEBUG flag to TRUE when
      debugger is linked. These modification already existed in the
      past but was removed by Ryszard. Ryszard I know that in Clipper
      _SET_DEBUG is always set to FALSE at application startup but
      if we make the same then we will not be Clipper compatible.
      These is a note I left in source/rtl/set.c which should explain why:

      Tests shows that Clipper has two different flags to control ALT+D
      and ALTD() behavior and on startup these flags are not synchronized.
      When application starts _SET_DEBUG is set to FALSE but debugger
      can be activated by hitting K_ALT_D or calling ALTD() function without
      parameter. It means that some other internal flag enables these
      operations.
      Because Harbour is using _SET_DEBUG flag only then we have to
      initialize it to TRUE when debugger is linked to keep real Clipper
      behavior or we will have to add second flag too and try to replicate
      exactly unsynchronized behavior of these flags which exists in Clipper.
      IMHO it's a bug in Clipper (side effect of some internal solutions) and
      we should not try to emulate it [druzus].

    ! fixed a:={0}; ? a[1]++; ? a[1]
      By mistake I used HB_P_DUPLUNREF in two different context - to avoid
      confusion in the future I added HB_P_PUSHUNREF PCODE which should be
      used in assignment context

    * synced with fixes in devel branch. This patch includes also some
      extensions but most of them is disabled by default and I decided
      that it will be safer to commit some already tested code then
      manually update modifications merged with extensions. The most
      important are:

      ! fixed typo in hb_xvmGreaterEqualThenIntIs() - <= was used instead
        of >=
      ! fixed :&macro() messages used in WITH OBJECT structure and -gc3
        output
      ! fixed Harbour support for accessing string characters with array
        index operators []
      ! fixed very serious bug in HVM closing. The s_uiActionRequest flag
        was not cleared before hb_rddShutDown() so when RDD buffers were
        hot and flushing required some PCODE evaluation (f.e. index KEY
        or FOR expression) then they were not properly evaluated.
      ! fixed one of expected result in hbtest, it was neither Harbour nor
        Clipper result
      ! fixed macrocompiler for proper compilation of string with embedded
        ASCII NUL byte (chr(0)), f.e.:
           ? &("'["+chr(0)+"]'")
      ! use HB_P_DUPLUNREF instead of HB_P_DUPLICATE when assign is used in
        push context - Clipper compatible behavior, see:
           x:=10
           f(y:=iif(.t.,@x,))
           ? x, y
           func f(x)
           x+=100
           return nil
      + added missing hb_storptrGC()
      + added hack for potential problems caused by WITH OBJECT syntax
      * some warning fixes
